Project Title: Bioinformatics Report
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a basic analysis of DNA sequences from a FASTA file. 

Contents
Report.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and explanations.
dna2.fasta: An example FASTA file used as input for the analysis. 

Getting Started
To run this notebook and reproduce the analysis:

1. Run in Google Colab
The easiest way to run this notebook is directly in Google Colab, as it requires no local setup.

Open the following link or click on the badge in the preview file Report.ipynb to open the notebook in Google Colab: (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ekaterina-kosti/Report/blob/main/Report.ipynb)

Once in Colab, the first code cell will automatically clone this repository and set the correct working directory.
Run all cells in the notebook (Runtime > Run all) to execute the analysis.

2. Run Locally
If you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/ekaterina-kosti/Report/.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

pip install jupyter
jupyter lab
or
jupyter notebook
Navigate to genomics_report.ipynb in the Jupyter file browser and open it.
Run all cells to execute the analysis.
